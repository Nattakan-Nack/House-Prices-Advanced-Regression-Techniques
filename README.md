# House Price Prediction with Machine Learning

This repository contains a project to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes a dataset (likely from Kaggle's House Prices competition) and explores various regression models for price prediction.

## Project Overview

The project is structured as follows:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Loads the dataset (train.csv) and performs basic exploration to understand the data's structure, features, and potential issues like missing values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzes the dataset with visualization tools like heatmaps and pairplots to identify correlations between features and target variable (SalePrice).
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Trains various regression models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, to predict house prices. The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
4. **Model Comparison**: Compares the performance of the trained models to select the most effective one for the given dataset.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## How to Use

1. **Download the Dataset**: Download the `train.csv` dataset from Kaggle's House Prices competition (or another relevant dataset).
2. **Upload to Google Colab**: Upload the `train.csv` file to your Google Colab environment.
3. **Run the Notebook**: Execute the code cells in the provided Jupyter Notebook.

## Results

The project demonstrates that advanced machine learning models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting generally outperform Linear Regression in predicting house prices. The models achieve respectable levels of accuracy in predicting the SalePrice, with MAE and RMSE values showing the effectiveness of the methods used.

## Future Improvements

- **Feature Engineering**: Experiment with creating new features from existing ones to potentially improve model performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the hyperparameters of the chosen model using techniques like Grid Search or Randomized Search to further improve accuracy.
- **Model Ensemble**: Combine predictions from multiple models to achieve better results.
- **More Advanced Models**: Explore more advanced machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost or LightGBM.
